This script allows to easily change the Mac address of the network interface of a computer under windows, the network interface can be changed but the script is initially designed for this interface.

The script also allows manual changes, repetitive changes and has built-in Mac OUI to spoofer certain brands of specific devices in a network such as: Mac, Asus, Dell, HP and others with sometimes several different YES. if the repetitive mac change mode is chosen, the time between each change of mac addresses is not fixed but varies around a value to avoid predictability as much as possible, for example: 10 seconds -> between 7 and 13 seconds

⚠️⚠️⚠️The script only functional with administrator rights due to the change of macs commands in "change mac windows"⚠️⚠️⚠️
